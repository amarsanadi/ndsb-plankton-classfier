# ndsb-plankton-classfier

This is a clssifier for plankton images using Convolutional Neural Networks, written in Lua and using Torch7.
I entered the National Data Science Bowl competition on Kaggle to learn the fundamentals of Machine Learning/Neural Networks
and in particular the usage of CNN's for image classification.
